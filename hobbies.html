<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h4>Welcome to my corner of interests!</h4>

<ul>
    <li><p>Reading: I find solace and inspiration within the pages of books. Whether it's
        diving into fictional worlds, exploring <br />non-fiction realms, or staying updated on 
        the latest tech trends, reading is a constant source of knowledge and joy in my life.</p></li>

    <li><p>Coding: Beyond being a career path, coding is a creative outlet for me. Crafting 
        solutions, tackling challenges, and <br />bringing ideas to life through programming is not 
        just a skill but a source of genuine excitement and fulfillment.</p></li>

    <li><p>Learning: A perpetual student, I thrive on the thrill of acquiring new knowledge. 
        From online courses to workshops,<br> I'm always seeking opportunities to expand my skill set 
        and stay at the forefront of emerging technologies.</p></li>
